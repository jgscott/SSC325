In class
--------

There's only the Wednesday meeting this week, and there will be a bit more reading than usual.  In class, we will briefly review simple group-wise models, and discuss fitting simple parametric curves by linear least squares.

Data and R scripts for class: 
* [leastsquares.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/leastsquares.R)
* [hubble.txt](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/hubble.txt)
* [afc.csv](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/afc.csv) and [afc.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/afc.R)
* [bacteria.txt](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/bacteria.txt)
* [gdpgrowth.csv](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/gdpgrowth.csv)

Read, watch, practice
---------------------

Read page 37-70 of Chapter 2 in the course packet, on linear least squares and transformations.  Then read the section starting on pages 108 of Tufte's Data Analysis for Politics and Policy, on "Interpretation of Regression Coefficients when the Variables are Re-expressed as Logarithms."

Some good supplemental readings include the following:
* Pages 18-30 and pages 65-69 (stopping just after Figure 3.3) of Tufte (Data Analysis for Politics and Policy), from the resources tab.
* Chapter 7 from [OpenIntro: Stats](http://www.openintro.org/stat/) is about linear regression.  OpenIntro:Stats is an open-access, introductory textbook about statistics.  Sections 7.1 through 7.3 are the most appropriate for this week

Exercises
---------
[Zip file here.](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/exercises/exercises02-SSC325H.zip) Due Wednesday, January 30, 2013.  You will fitting some simple curves to data sets using linear least squares, as embodied in R's lm() function.  The practice problem is a simple linear model; you don't need to turn this one in, and there's an associated R script in "heights.R" to walk you through the example. The first two real exercises involve fitting non-linear functions by linear least squares.  The third problem involves a bit of math.
