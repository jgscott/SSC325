In class
--------

Week 3, in which we: (1) discuss a statistical model as a partition of observed variation into predictable and unpredictable components; and (2) learn about dummy variables and interactions for modeling data that have both grouping variables and quantitative variables.

Data and R scripts for this week: 
* [sumsq.csv](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/sumsq.csv) and [sumsq.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/sumsq.R)
* [pickup.csv](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/pickup.csv) and [pickup.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/pickup.R)

Read, watch, practice
---------------------

Read Chapter 3 in the course packet, on predictable and unpredictable variation.  Also read Chapters 3-4 of Kaplan's Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach.  These are available free through the author's website: [Ch3](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/Chapters/Chapter-03.pdf), [Ch4](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/Chapters/Chapter-04.pdf).

A good supplemental reading this week would be the rest of Chapter 3 from Tufte (Data Analysis for Politics and Policy), from the resources tab, starting on page 69.  This whole chapter is about quantifying variability in the simple linear regression model, and concludes with a long series of examples. Read as many as you care to.

Exercises
---------
[Zip file here.](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/exercises/exercises03-SSC325H.zip) Due Wednesday, February 6, 2013.  Two important skills to practice here: estimating a [naive prediction interval](http://youtu.be/k3e0WSiBti8?t=2m51s), and fitting/interpreting linear models with both a quantitative and grouping variable as predictors.  You will also learn a bit about the stock market through the lens of regression, and try your hand at ecological theorizing.
