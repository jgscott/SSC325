Probability and random variables, perhaps with a bit of material on utility, risk, and decision-making.


Read
--------
The first two are required; the third one is optional.
* [Probability](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/files/probability.pdf)
* [Random variables](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/files/randomvariables.pdf)
* [Utility](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/files/utility.pdf)

Chapters 2 and 3 of the [OpenIntro: Statistics](http://www.openintro.org/stat/) book are good references as you think through your homework problems.

If you have a copy of the Kaplan book, chapter 11 on Modeling Randomness is also good here.

To be posted by Wednesday, February 20.
