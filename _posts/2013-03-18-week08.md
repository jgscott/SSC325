This week we talk about multiple regression, especially its use in "statistical adjustment."

Read, watch, practice
---------------------
Read Chapter 4 on Multiple Regression from Tufte's Data Analysis for Politics and Policy, from the [Resources](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/resources.html) tab.  Another good (free) reference is the material in Sections 8.1-8.3 of [OpenIntro: Stats.](http://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php).
