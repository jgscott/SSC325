In class
--------

This week, we talk briefly about the perils of causal reasoning using data.  Then we talk about some principles for good and bad statistical graphs, and introduce some simple methods for exploring multivariate data.

Data and R scripts for class: 
* [titanic.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/titanic.R)
* [citytemps.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/citytemps.R), [casandie.txt](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/casandie.txt), and [sdrapcty.txt](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/sdrapcty.txt)
* [ut2000.csv](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/ut2000.csv) and [ut2000.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/ut2000.R)
* [mammalsleep.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/mammalsleep.r)

Read, watch, practice
---------------------

Two steps are the most important.

* Make sure to install [R](http://http://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org) on your own computer.
* Read up through page 37 of the online course packet.  This includes the introduction, Chapter 1, and part of Chapter 2.  These readings are available from the [resources](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/resources.html) page.

If you are feeling a little uncomfortable with the idea of R, watch and follow along with these videos from the [R Tutorial](http://dist.stat.tamu.edu/pub/rvideos/) website:

1. Libraries and Packages
2. Reading in Files
3. Inputting Data
4. Getting Help in R
5. Saving Work
6. Basic Statistics


Some good supplemental readings include the following:
* [Chapter 1](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/Chapters/Chapter-01.pdf) of Kaplan
* pages 1-18 of Tufte

Exercises
---------
Due Wednesday, January 23, 2013.  In this first set of exercises, you will read a news article (and the academic paper it reports on) concerning the effect of maternal methampetamine use on child health.  You will also practice fitting simple group-wise models, and prove a simple result about the optimality of group-wise means under the least-squares criterion.  All the necessary files are in [this ZIP file.](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/exercises/01/exercises01.zip)
