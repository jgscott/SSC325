In class

Week 7, in which we conclude our introduction to hypothesis testing by discussing the Neyman-Pearson framework, and continue our discussion of probability models by considered a few basic problems of parametric inference.

Data and R scripts for this week: 
* [cps85.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/cps85.R)
* [ut2000.csv](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/ut2000.csv) and [ut2000-permtest.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/ut2000-permtest.R)

Read, watch, practice
---------------------

Read pages 151-163 in [Chapter 7](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/files/07-QuantifyingUncertaintyPart2.pdf) in the course packet, stopping before the section on "Hypothesis testing for regression coefficients." (Yes, I know this is 7 and the last chapter was 4... my notes are in the middle of being re-organized.)

Supplemental reading: Section 4.3 of [OpenIntro: Statistics](http://www.openintro.org/stat/).
