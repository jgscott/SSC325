Read, watch, practice
---------------------

Read pages 151-163 in [Chapter 7](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/files/07-QuantifyingUncertaintyPart2.pdf) in the course packet, stopping before the section on "Hypothesis testing for regression coefficients." (Yes, I know this is 7 and the last chapter was 4... my notes are in the middle of being re-organized.)

Supplemental reading: Section 4.3 of [OpenIntro: Statistics](http://www.openintro.org/stat/).
