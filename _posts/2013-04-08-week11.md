Read, watch, practice
---------------------
Last week's reading on discrete outcomes will shed light on logistic regression!  For some more advanced reading about the material on generalized linear models that we'll cover on Wednesday, try [these notes from Simon Jackman](http://jackman.stanford.edu/papers/glm.pdf) at Stanford University.

Looking ahead to next week, you should read the chapters on causality from the Kaplan book, [available free here](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/Chapters/Chapter-17.pdf) and [here](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/Chapters/Chapter-18.pdf).  These will bring us full circle to the beginning of the course, when we discussed good and bad evidence in support of causal claims.
