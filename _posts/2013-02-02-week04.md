In class
--------

Week 4, in which we: (1) continue our discussion of dummy variables and interactions for modeling data that have both grouping variables and quantitative variables; and (2) introduce the idea of a sampling distribution, which is at the heart of the frequentist approach to uncertainty quantification in statistical modeling.  Time permitting, we will introduce the notion of the bootstrap.

Data and R scripts for this week: 

* [rxtime.txt](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/rxntime.txt) and [rxntime.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/rxntime.R)
* [house.csv](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/house.csv) and [house.R](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/r/house.R)
* [peakdemand.csv](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/data/peakdemand.csv)

Read, watch, practice
---------------------

Watch the [video tutorial](http://youtu.be/KXje1p-IU0g) associated with the house.R script, if you want to hear me explain these commands.  There is also a [short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_M5hpTUsC8) on extracting coefficients, fitted values, residuals, and R^2 from a fitted linear model object.

<br>

Read pages 79-91 of Chapter 4 in the course packet, and Chapter 5 of Kaplan (finish Chapters 3-4, if you haven't already), available free through the author's website: [Ch5](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/Chapters/Chapter-05.pdf).


Exercises
---------
[Zip file here.](http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/exercises/exercises04-SSC325H.zip) Due Wednesday, February 13, 2013.  This is about the idea of sampling distributions, and about quantifying uncertainty using a two key ideas: cross-validation and bootstrapping.
