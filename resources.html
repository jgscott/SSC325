  <a href="http://jgscott.github.com/SSC325/files/DAPP.pdf">Data Analysis for
  Politics and Policy</a>, by Edward Tufte.  Out of print, but
  available for free in electronic form. I will often assign
  supplemental readings out of this book. <br>
  </p>
  <p> 
    <a href="http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/Chapters/">Statistical
  Modeling: A Fresh Approach</a>, by Daniel Kaplan.  Great book, great
  exercises.  The first five chapters are available for free.  You may find the first one especially helpful in learning some basic R commands.  You are certainly not required to buy this book, but you may find it to be a useful resource, and I will give supplemental readings out of it for those that are interested.

    <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Verzani-SimpleR.pdf">Using
 R for Introductory Statistics</a>  A useful guide on doing basic
 statistics in R.

 fantastic resource. <br>
